# flat_definition
Python parser to load flat file definitions from arbitrary sources.
Currently, will read a Microsoft Excel File (thanks to OpenPyXl) and can 
seek out column headers, and attempt to identify a file header.

Primary goal will be to extract definition data concerning fixed width files
that aren't delimited, in order to process them in a business sense.

Any contributions and suggestions would be more than appreciated.

Thanks,

Bullet-Terrier
